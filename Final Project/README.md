# CSCI 1175 Final Project
## This is my Final Project for CSCI 1175 Industry Projects Coursework at Southwest Technical College. It is a multiplayer trivia game using socket networking.
## I built this software to show the skills I have learned during this course and because trivia games are fun!
## To run this program you will need the Server.java file and both Client and Client2.java files. Run the server file first and then the Client files in any order.
